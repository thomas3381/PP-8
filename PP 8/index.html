            <h2>1. Understanding PayPal Refunds</h2>
            <p>When you make a payment on PayPal, you can request a refund under certain conditions. Refunds may apply to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unauthorised transactions:</strong> If a payment was made without your consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Product or service not received:</strong> If you paid for something that you didn’t receive or it didn’t meet the seller’s description.</li>
                <li><strong>Order cancellation:</strong> If you cancel a transaction before it is processed, you can request a refund.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PayPal's refund process can vary depending on the type of transaction and whether you paid with your PayPal balance, credit card, or bank account.</p>
